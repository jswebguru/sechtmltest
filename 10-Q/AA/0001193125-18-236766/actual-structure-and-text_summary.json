These Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary by management to fairly state the Companys\nresults of operations, financial position, and cash flows. The results reported in these Consolidated Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. The 2017 year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). This Form 10-Q report should be read in conjunction with the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which includes all disclosures required\nby GAAP. Certain amounts in previously issued financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation (see Note B). References in these Notes to ParentCo refer to Alcoa Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries (through\nOctober 31, 2016, at which time was renamed Arconic Inc. (Arconic)). On November 1, 2016 (the Separation Date), ParentCo separated into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Alcoa Corporation and Arconic (the\nSeparation Transaction). In connection with the Separation Transaction, as of October 31, 2016, the Company and Arconic entered into several agreements to effect the Separation Transaction, including a Separation and Distribution\nAgreement and a Tax Matters Agreement. See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of Alcoa Corporations Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for\nadditional information. Principles of Consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements of Alcoa Corporation include the\naccounts of Alcoa Corporation and companies in which Alcoa Corporation has a controlling interest, including those that comprise the Alcoa World Alumina & Chemicals (AWAC) joint venture (see below). Intercompany transactions have been\neliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliates and other joint ventures over which Alcoa Corporation has significant influence but does not have effective control. Investments in affiliates in which Alcoa\nCorporation cannot exercise significant influence are accounted for on the cost method. AWAC is an unincorporated global joint venture\nbetween Alcoa Corporation and Alumina Limited and consists of several affiliated operating entities, which own, or have an interest in, or operate the bauxite mines and alumina refineries within Alcoa Corporations Bauxite and Alumina segments\n(except for the Poços de Caldas mine and refinery and a portion of the São Luís refinery, all in Brazil) and the Portland smelter in Australia. Alcoa Corporation owns 60% and Alumina Limited owns 40% of these individual\nentities, which are consolidated by the Company for financial reporting purposes and include Alcoa of Australia Limited, Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA), and Alcoa World Alumina Brasil Ltda. (AWAB). Alumina Limiteds interest in the equity of\nsuch entities is reflected as Noncontrolling interest on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet."

            "text_content": "On\nJanuary 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. This guidance created a comprehensive framework for all entities in all\nindustries to apply in the determination of when to recognize revenue, and, therefore, supersedes virtually all existing revenue recognition requirements and guidance. This framework is expected to result in less complex guidance in application\nwhile providing a consistent and comparable methodology for revenue recognition. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer,\n(ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract(s), (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract(s), and (v) recognize revenue when, or as,\nthe entity satisfies a performance obligation. Managements assessment of this guidance was applied only to those customer contracts that were open on the date of adoption under the modified retrospective method. Through a previously\nestablished project team, the Company completed a detailed review of the terms and provisions of its \ncustomer contracts, as well as evaluated these contracts under the new guidance, throughout 2017 and concluded that Alcoa Corporations revenue recognition practices were in compliance with\nthis framework. That said, the Company did make some minor modifications to its internal accounting policies and internal control structure to ensure that any future customer contracts that may have different terms and conditions of those that the\nCompany has today are properly evaluated under the new guidance. Other than providing additional disclosure (see Note C), the adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation adopted guidance issued by the FASB to the accounting and reporting of certain equity investments.\nThis guidance requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.\nHowever, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical\nor similar investment of the same issuer. Additionally, the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values has been simplified by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. The adoption of this\nguidance had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements, as all of Alcoa Corporations equity investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. On January 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation adopted guidance issued by the FASB to the presentation of several items in the statement of cash\nflows. Specifically, the guidance identifies nine cash flow items and the sections where they must be presented within the statement of cash flows, including distributions received from equity method investees, proceeds from the settlement of\ninsurance claims, and restricted cash. Other than as it relates to restricted cash, the adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. This guidance requires that restricted cash be aggregated with cash and cash\nequivalents in both the beginning-of-period and end-of-period line items at the bottom of\nthe statement of cash flows. Previously, the change in restricted cash between the beginning-of-period and end-of period was\nreflected as either an investing, financing, operating, or non-cash activity based on the underlying nature of the transaction. Accordingly, for the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the\nsix months ended June 30, 2018, the Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of year and Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period line items include restricted cash of $7 and $6, respectively.\nAdditionally, the Companys Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was recast to reflect this change in presentation. As a result, the Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of year\nand Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period line items include restricted cash of $6 and $11 respectively. Of the $5 increase in restricted cash for the six months ended June 30, 2017, $4 was previously presented as a\ncash outflow in the investing activities section of the Companys Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The remaining change of $1 is now reflected in the Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and\ncash equivalents and restricted cash line item. The following table provides a reconciliation of Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash reported in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet that sum to the Cash and cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash at both the beginning of year and end of period presented on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2018:"

            "text_content": "On January 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation adopted guidance issued by the FASB to the accounting for\nintra-entity transactions, other than inventory. The guidance requires the current and deferred income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer to be recorded immediately when the transaction occurs; the exception to defer the tax\nconsequences of inventory transactions is maintained. Prior to this guidance, no immediate tax impact was permitted to be recognized in an entitys financial statements as a result of intra-entity transfers of assets. An entity was precluded\nfrom reflecting a tax benefit or expense from an intra-entity asset transfer between entities that file separate tax returns, whether or not such entities are in different tax jurisdictions, until the asset had been sold to a third party or\notherwise recovered. The buyer of such asset was prohibited from recognizing a deferred tax asset for the temporary difference arising from the excess of the buyers tax basis over the cost to the seller. The adoption of this guidance had\nan immaterial impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation adopted guidance issued by the FASB to accounting for\nbusiness combinations. This guidance clarifies the definition of a business for the purposes of evaluating whether a particular transaction should be accounted for as an acquisition or disposal of a business or an asset. Generally, a business is an\nintegrated set of assets and activities that contain inputs, processes, and outputs, although outputs are not required. This guidance provides a screen to determine whether an integrated set of assets and activities qualifies as a\nbusiness. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the definition of a business has not been met and the transaction should be accounted for\nas an acquisition or disposal of an asset. Otherwise, an entity is required to evaluate whether the integrated set of assets and activities include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the\nability to create output and are no longer to consider whether a market participant could replace any missing elements. This guidance also narrows the definition of an output. Previously, an output was defined as the ability to provide a return in\nthe form of dividends, lower costs, or other economic benefits directly to investors, owners, members, or participants. An output is now defined as the ability to provide goods or services to customers, investment income, or other revenues. The\nadoption of this guidance had no immediate impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements; however, this guidance will need to be considered in the event Alcoa Corporation acquires or disposes of an integrated set of assets and activities. On January 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation early adopted guidance issued by the FASB to the assessment of goodwill for impairment as it\nrelates to the quantitative test. Prior to this guidance, there were two steps when performing a quantitative impairment test. The first step required an entity to compare the current fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. In the\nevent the reporting units estimated fair value was less than its carrying value, an entity performed the second step, which was to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill.\nThe implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the\nfair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeded its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to such excess was recognized. This guidance eliminates the second step of the quantitative\nimpairment test. Accordingly, an entity would recognize an impairment of goodwill for a reporting unit, if under what was previously referred to as the first step, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. The\nimpairment would be equal to the excess of the reporting units carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill applicable to that reporting unit. The adoption of this guidance had no immediate impact on the\nConsolidated Financial Statements; however, this guidance will need to be considered each time the Company performs an assessment of goodwill for impairment under the quantitative test. On January 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation adopted guidance issued by the FASB to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost related to\npension and other postretirement benefit plans. This guidance requires that an entity report the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same line item(s) on its income statement as other compensation costs arising from services\nrendered by the pertinent employees during a reporting period. The other components of net periodic benefit cost (see Note K) are required to be reported separately from the service cost component. In other words, these other components may be\naggregated and presented as a separate line item or they may be reported in existing line items on the income statement other than such line items that include the service cost component. Previously, Alcoa Corporation reported all components of net\nperiodic benefit cost, except for certain settlements, curtailments, and special termination benefits, in Cost of goods sold (business employees) and Selling, general administrative, and other expenses (corporate employees) consistent with the\nlocation of other compensation costs related to the respective employees. The non-service cost components noted as exceptions are reported in Restructuring and other charges, as applicable. Additionally, this\nguidance only permits the service cost component to be capitalized as applicable (e.g., as a cost of internally manufactured inventory). Upon adoption of this guidance, management began reporting the\nnon-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost, except for certain settlements, curtailments, and special termination benefits that will continue to be reported in Restructuring and other charges, in\nOther expenses (income), net on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations (see Note K). For the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018, the non-service cost components reported in\nOther expenses, net was $39 and $77, respectively. Additionally, the Statement of Consolidated Operations for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017 was recast to reflect the reclassification of the\nnon-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost to Other expense (income), net from both Cost of goods sold and Selling, general administrative, and other expenses. As a result, for the second quarter\nand six months ended June 30, 2017, Cost of goods sold decreased by $20 and $40, respectively, Selling, general administrative, and other expenses decreased by $2 and $3, respectively, and Other expenses (income), net changed by $22 and $43,\nrespectively, \nfrom previously reported amounts. Under the practical expedient option provided for in the guidance, the Company used previously disclosed amounts for\nnon-service cost components to recast these line items for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017. Furthermore, Alcoa Corporation no longer capitalizes any\nnon-service cost components as part of the cost of inventory prospectively beginning January 1, 2018. On January 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation adopted guidance issued by the FASB to the accounting for stock-based compensation when there has\nbeen a modification to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. This guidance requires an entity to account for the modification only when there has been a substantive change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award.\nA substantive change occurs when the fair value, vesting conditions or balance sheet classification (liability or equity) of a share-based payment award is/are different immediately before and after the modification. Previously, an entity was\nrequired to account for any modification in the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The adoption of this guidance had no immediate impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements; however, this guidance will need to be considered if\nthe Company initiates a modification that is determined to be a substantive change to an outstanding share-based award. Additionally, the Company will no longer account for any future non-substantive change to\nthe terms or conditions of a share-based payment awards as a modification. On April 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation early adopted\nguidance issued by the FASB to the accounting for hedging activities retroactive to January 1, 2018. This guidance permits hedge accounting for risk components in hedging relationships involving nonfinancial risk and interest rate risk; reduces\ncurrent limitations on the designation and measurement of a hedged item in a fair value hedge of interest rate risk; removes the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness; provides an election to systematically and\nrationally recognize in earnings the initial value of any amount excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for all types of hedges; and eases the requirements of effectiveness testing. Additionally, modifications to existing disclosures,\nas well as additional disclosures, are required, as applicable, to reflect these changes regarding the measurement and recognition of hedging activities. This guidance is to be initially applied only to hedging instruments that exist as of the\nadoption date using the modified retrospective method. In other words, any financial statement impact from application of these changes to open hedging instruments as of the adoption date related to periods prior to the adoption year is to be\nrecognized through a cumulative effect adjustment in beginning retained earnings of the adoption year. Accordingly, upon adoption of this guidance, Alcoa Corporation recognized an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment within equity effective\nJanuary 1, 2018 related to open Level 1 hedging instruments as of the adoption date. The Company had no open Level 2 hedging instruments as of the adoption date and there was no financial statement impact from Alcoa Corporations\nopen Level 3 hedging instruments as of the adoption date. This guidance will also be applied prospectively upon the Company entering into any new hedging instruments. See the Derivatives section of Note L for additional information."

            "text_content": "In January 2018, the FASB issued\nguidance regarding the assessment of land easements (or rights of way) under the pending lease accounting requirements to be adopted on January 1, 2019 (see Recently Issued Accounting Guidance in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nin Part II Item 8 of Alcoa Corporations Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017). This guidance provides an entity an option to not evaluate existing or expired land\neasements as leases in preparation for the adoption of the new lease accounting requirements, as long as such land easements were recorded as something other than leases under current accounting requirements. That said, any new land easement\nacquired or existing land easement modified on January 1, 2019 or later must be assessed for lease accounting under the new requirements. This guidance becomes effective for Alcoa Corporation on January 1, 2019. Management plans to elect\nthe option to not evaluate existing or expired land easements that are currently accounted for as something other than leases under the new lease accounting requirements. The Companys land easements are currently accounted for as fixed assets\nand are immaterial to Alcoa Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, management has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have an immediate impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe new lease accounting requirements will need to be considered if the Company acquires a new land easement or modifies an existing land easement on January 1, 2019 or later. In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance regarding the reclassification of certain income tax effects reported in accumulated comprehensive\nincome (loss) in response to U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA). For corporations, one of the main provisions of the TCJA was the reduction in the corporate\nincome tax rate to 21% from 35%. Under current income tax accounting requirements, an entity was required to remeasure applicable \nU.S. deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at the 21% tax rate effective on the TCJA enactment date. This remeasurement was required to be recognized in an entitys income tax\nprovision in its income statement. However, certain of these deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income tax effects initially recognized at the 35% tax rate through other comprehensive income (loss) on items reported within\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on an entitys balance sheet. Consequently, an entitys financial statements will reflect an inconsistency between the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities measured at 21% and the\nrelated income tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) recorded at 35%. Accordingly, this guidance provides a one-time option to remeasure the income tax effects within accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) at the 21% income tax rate. The impact from this remeasurement is to be recorded directly in retained earnings on an entitys balance sheet. This guidance becomes effective for Alcoa Corporation on January 1,\n2019, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating whether to elect this option, as well as whether to early adopt the guidance. If management elects to apply this guidance, the impact on the Companys Consolidated Balance\nSheet is estimated to be an increase of approximately $350 to both Retained earnings and Accumulated other comprehensive loss. In June\n2018, the FASB issued guidance regarding the accounting for nonemployee share-based payment transactions. This guidance effectively changes the accounting for such transactions to be consistent with the accounting for employee share-based payment\ntransactions. The nonemployee share-based payment transactions subject to this guidance are those in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantors own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. This\nguidance is not to be applied to other nonemployee share-based payment transactions, such as those used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as\npart of a contract accounted for under revenue recognition principles. This guidance becomes effective for Alcoa Corporation on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The only nonemployees to receive share-based payments from Alcoa\nCorporation are the members of the Companys Board of Directors. Accordingly, management does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. "

            "text_content": "The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation(s) in accordance with the provisions of a customer order or\ncontract. This is achieved when control of the product has been transferred to the customer, which is generally determined when title, ownership, and risk of loss pass to the customer, all of which occurs upon shipment or delivery of the product.\nThe shipping terms vary across all businesses and depend on the product, the country of origin, and the type of transportation (commercial delivery truck, train, or vessel). Accordingly, except for the sale of electricity, the sale of Alcoa\nCorporations products to its customers represent single performance obligations for which revenue is recognized at a point in time. Based on the foregoing, no significant judgment is required to determine when control of a product has been\ntransferred to a customer. The Company measures revenue based on the consideration it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for\nits products. The standard terms and conditions of customer orders and contracts include general rights of return and product warranty provisions related to nonconforming or\nout-of-spec product. Depending on the circumstances, the product is either replaced or a quality adjustment is issued. Historically, such returns and\nadjustments have not been material to Alcoa Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company considers shipping and\nhandling activities as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the related products. As a result, customer payments of shipping and handling costs are recorded as a component of revenue. Also, Alcoa Corporation may collect various taxes (e.g.,\nsales, use, value-added, excise) from its customers related to the sale of its products and remit such amounts to governmental authorities. As such, amounts paid to the Company for these types of taxes are excluded from the transaction price used to\ndetermine the proper measurement of revenue. Alcoa Corporation has five product divisions as follows: BauxiteBauxite is a reddish clay rock that is mined from the surface of the earths terrain. This ore is the basic raw\nmaterial used to produce alumina and is the primary source of aluminum. AluminaAlumina is an oxide that is extracted from\nbauxite and is the basic raw material used to produce primary aluminum. This product can also be consumed for non-metallurgical purposes, such as industrial chemical products. Primary aluminumPrimary aluminum is metal in the form of a common alloy ingot (e.g.,\nt-bar, sow, standard ingot) or a value-add ingot (e.g., billet, rod, and slab). These products are sold primarily to customers that produce products for the\ntransportation, building and construction, packaging, wire, and other industrial markets. Flat-rolled aluminumFlat-rolled aluminum is metal in the form of sheet, which is\nsold primarily to customers that produce beverage and food cans, including body, tab, and end stock. EnergyEnergy is the\ngeneration of electricity, which is sold in the wholesale market to traders, large industrial consumers, distribution companies, and other generation companies. The following table represents the general commercial profile of the Companys Bauxite, Alumina, Primary aluminum, and Flat-rolled\naluminum product divisions (see text below table for Energy):"

See Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of Alcoa Corporations Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for\nadditional information. Principles of Consolidation. The Consolidated Financial Statements of Alcoa Corporation include the\naccounts of Alcoa Corporation and companies in which Alcoa Corporation has a controlling interest, including those that comprise the Alcoa World Alumina & Chemicals (AWAC) joint venture (see below). Intercompany transactions have been\neliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliates and other joint ventures over which Alcoa Corporation has significant influence but does not have effective control. Investments in affiliates in which Alcoa\nCorporation cannot exercise significant influence are accounted for on the cost method. AWAC is an unincorporated global joint venture\nbetween Alcoa Corporation and Alumina Limited and consists of several affiliated operating entities, which own, or have an interest in, or operate the bauxite mines and alumina refineries within Alcoa Corporations Bauxite and Alumina segments\n(except for the Poços de Caldas mine and refinery and a portion of the São Luís refinery, all in Brazil) and the Portland smelter in Australia. Alcoa Corporation owns 60% and Alumina Limited owns 40% of these individual\nentities, which are consolidated by the Company for financial reporting purposes and include Alcoa of Australia Limited, Alcoa World Alumina LLC (AWA), and Alcoa World Alumina Brasil Ltda. (AWAB). Alumina Limiteds interest in the equity of\nsuch entities is reflected as Noncontrolling interest on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. B. Recently Adopted and Recently Issued\nAccounting Guidance Adopted On\nJanuary 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. This guidance created a comprehensive framework for all entities in all\nindustries to apply in the determination of when to recognize revenue, and, therefore, supersedes virtually all existing revenue recognition requirements and guidance. This framework is expected to result in less complex guidance in application\nwhile providing a consistent and comparable methodology for revenue recognition. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that\nreflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer,\n(ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract(s), (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract(s), and (v) recognize revenue when, or as,\nthe entity satisfies a performance obligation. Managements assessment of this guidance was applied only to those customer contracts that were open on the date of adoption under the modified retrospective method. Through a previously\nestablished project team, the Company completed a detailed review of the terms and provisions of its \ncustomer contracts, as well as evaluated these contracts under the new guidance, throughout 2017 and concluded that Alcoa Corporations revenue recognition practices were in compliance with\nthis framework. That said, the Company did make some minor modifications to its internal accounting policies and internal control structure to ensure that any future customer contracts that may have different terms and conditions of those that the\nCompany has today are properly evaluated under the new guidance. Other than providing additional disclosure (see Note C), the adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation adopted guidance issued by the FASB to the accounting and reporting of certain equity investments.\nThis guidance requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.\nHowever, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical\nor similar investment of the same issuer. Additionally, the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values has been simplified by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. The adoption of this\nguidance had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements, as all of Alcoa Corporations equity investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. On January 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation adopted guidance issued by the FASB to the presentation of several items in the statement of cash\nflows. Specifically, the guidance identifies nine cash flow items and the sections where they must be presented within the statement of cash flows, including distributions received from equity method investees, proceeds from the settlement of\ninsurance claims, and restricted cash. Other than as it relates to restricted cash, the adoption of this guidance had no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. This guidance requires that restricted cash be aggregated with cash and cash\nequivalents in both the beginning-of-period and end-of-period line items at the bottom of\nthe statement of cash flows. Previously, the change in restricted cash between the beginning-of-period and end-of period was\nreflected as either an investing, financing, operating, or non-cash activity based on the underlying nature of the transaction. Accordingly, for the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the\nsix months ended June 30, 2018, the Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of year and Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period line items include restricted cash of $7 and $6, respectively.\nAdditionally, the Companys Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was recast to reflect this change in presentation. As a result, the Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of year\nand Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period line items include restricted cash of $6 and $11 respectively. Of the $5 increase in restricted cash for the six months ended June 30, 2017, $4 was previously presented as a\ncash outflow in the investing activities section of the Companys Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The remaining change of $1 is now reflected in the Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and\ncash equivalents and restricted cash line item. The following table provides a reconciliation of Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash reported in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet that sum to the Cash and cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash at both the beginning of year and end of period presented on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2018:"

On January 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation adopted guidance issued by the FASB to the accounting for\nintra-entity transactions, other than inventory. The guidance requires the current and deferred income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer to be recorded immediately when the transaction occurs; the exception to defer the tax\nconsequences of inventory transactions is maintained. Prior to this guidance, no immediate tax impact was permitted to be recognized in an entitys financial statements as a result of intra-entity transfers of assets. An entity was precluded\nfrom reflecting a tax benefit or expense from an intra-entity asset transfer between entities that file separate tax returns, whether or not such entities are in different tax jurisdictions, until the asset had been sold to a third party or\notherwise recovered. The buyer of such asset was prohibited from recognizing a deferred tax asset for the temporary difference arising from the excess of the buyers tax basis over the cost to the seller. The adoption of this guidance had\nan immaterial impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. On January 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation adopted guidance issued by the FASB to accounting for\nbusiness combinations. This guidance clarifies the definition of a business for the purposes of evaluating whether a particular transaction should be accounted for as an acquisition or disposal of a business or an asset. Generally, a business is an\nintegrated set of assets and activities that contain inputs, processes, and outputs, although outputs are not required. This guidance provides a screen to determine whether an integrated set of assets and activities qualifies as a\nbusiness. If substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the definition of a business has not been met and the transaction should be accounted for\nas an acquisition or disposal of an asset. Otherwise, an entity is required to evaluate whether the integrated set of assets and activities include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the\nability to create output and are no longer to consider whether a market participant could replace any missing elements. This guidance also narrows the definition of an output. Previously, an output was defined as the ability to provide a return in\nthe form of dividends, lower costs, or other economic benefits directly to investors, owners, members, or participants. An output is now defined as the ability to provide goods or services to customers, investment income, or other revenues. The\nadoption of this guidance had no immediate impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements; however, this guidance will need to be considered in the event Alcoa Corporation acquires or disposes of an integrated set of assets and activities. On January 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation early adopted guidance issued by the FASB to the assessment of goodwill for impairment as it\nrelates to the quantitative test. Prior to this guidance, there were two steps when performing a quantitative impairment test. The first step required an entity to compare the current fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. In the\nevent the reporting units estimated fair value was less than its carrying value, an entity performed the second step, which was to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill.\nThe implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the\nfair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeded its implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to such excess was recognized. This guidance eliminates the second step of the quantitative\nimpairment test. Accordingly, an entity would recognize an impairment of goodwill for a reporting unit, if under what was previously referred to as the first step, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value. The\nimpairment would be equal to the excess of the reporting units carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill applicable to that reporting unit. The adoption of this guidance had no immediate impact on the\nConsolidated Financial Statements; however, this guidance will need to be considered each time the Company performs an assessment of goodwill for impairment under the quantitative test. On January 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation adopted guidance issued by the FASB to the presentation of net periodic benefit cost related to\npension and other postretirement benefit plans. This guidance requires that an entity report the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same line item(s) on its income statement as other compensation costs arising from services\nrendered by the pertinent employees during a reporting period. The other components of net periodic benefit cost (see Note K) are required to be reported separately from the service cost component. In other words, these other components may be\naggregated and presented as a separate line item or they may be reported in existing line items on the income statement other than such line items that include the service cost component. Previously, Alcoa Corporation reported all components of net\nperiodic benefit cost, except for certain settlements, curtailments, and special termination benefits, in Cost of goods sold (business employees) and Selling, general administrative, and other expenses (corporate employees) consistent with the\nlocation of other compensation costs related to the respective employees. The non-service cost components noted as exceptions are reported in Restructuring and other charges, as applicable. Additionally, this\nguidance only permits the service cost component to be capitalized as applicable (e.g., as a cost of internally manufactured inventory). Upon adoption of this guidance, management began reporting the\nnon-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost, except for certain settlements, curtailments, and special termination benefits that will continue to be reported in Restructuring and other charges, in\nOther expenses (income), net on the accompanying Statement of Consolidated Operations (see Note K). For the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2018, the non-service cost components reported in\nOther expenses, net was $39 and $77, respectively. Additionally, the Statement of Consolidated Operations for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017 was recast to reflect the reclassification of the\nnon-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost to Other expense (income), net from both Cost of goods sold and Selling, general administrative, and other expenses. As a result, for the second quarter\nand six months ended June 30, 2017, Cost of goods sold decreased by $20 and $40, respectively, Selling, general administrative, and other expenses decreased by $2 and $3, respectively, and Other expenses (income), net changed by $22 and $43,\nrespectively, \nfrom previously reported amounts. Under the practical expedient option provided for in the guidance, the Company used previously disclosed amounts for\nnon-service cost components to recast these line items for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017. Furthermore, Alcoa Corporation no longer capitalizes any\nnon-service cost components as part of the cost of inventory prospectively beginning January 1, 2018. On January 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation adopted guidance issued by the FASB to the accounting for stock-based compensation when there has\nbeen a modification to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. This guidance requires an entity to account for the modification only when there has been a substantive change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award.\nA substantive change occurs when the fair value, vesting conditions or balance sheet classification (liability or equity) of a share-based payment award is/are different immediately before and after the modification. Previously, an entity was\nrequired to account for any modification in the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The adoption of this guidance had no immediate impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements; however, this guidance will need to be considered if\nthe Company initiates a modification that is determined to be a substantive change to an outstanding share-based award. Additionally, the Company will no longer account for any future non-substantive change to\nthe terms or conditions of a share-based payment awards as a modification. On April 1, 2018, Alcoa Corporation early adopted\nguidance issued by the FASB to the accounting for hedging activities retroactive to January 1, 2018. This guidance permits hedge accounting for risk components in hedging relationships involving nonfinancial risk and interest rate risk; reduces\ncurrent limitations on the designation and measurement of a hedged item in a fair value hedge of interest rate risk; removes the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness; provides an election to systematically and\nrationally recognize in earnings the initial value of any amount excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness for all types of hedges; and eases the requirements of effectiveness testing. Additionally, modifications to existing disclosures,\nas well as additional disclosures, are required, as applicable, to reflect these changes regarding the measurement and recognition of hedging activities. This guidance is to be initially applied only to hedging instruments that exist as of the\nadoption date using the modified retrospective method. In other words, any financial statement impact from application of these changes to open hedging instruments as of the adoption date related to periods prior to the adoption year is to be\nrecognized through a cumulative effect adjustment in beginning retained earnings of the adoption year. Accordingly, upon adoption of this guidance, Alcoa Corporation recognized an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment within equity effective\nJanuary 1, 2018 related to open Level 1 hedging instruments as of the adoption date. The Company had no open Level 2 hedging instruments as of the adoption date and there was no financial statement impact from Alcoa Corporations\nopen Level 3 hedging instruments as of the adoption date. This guidance will also be applied prospectively upon the Company entering into any new hedging instruments. See the Derivatives section of Note L for additional information. Issued In January 2018, the FASB issued\nguidance regarding the assessment of land easements (or rights of way) under the pending lease accounting requirements to be adopted on January 1, 2019 (see Recently Issued Accounting Guidance in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nin Part II Item 8 of Alcoa Corporations Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017). This guidance provides an entity an option to not evaluate existing or expired land\neasements as leases in preparation for the adoption of the new lease accounting requirements, as long as such land easements were recorded as something other than leases under current accounting requirements. That said, any new land easement\nacquired or existing land easement modified on January 1, 2019 or later must be assessed for lease accounting under the new requirements. This guidance becomes effective for Alcoa Corporation on January 1, 2019. Management plans to elect\nthe option to not evaluate existing or expired land easements that are currently accounted for as something other than leases under the new lease accounting requirements. The Companys land easements are currently accounted for as fixed assets\nand are immaterial to Alcoa Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements. Accordingly, management has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have an immediate impact on the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe new lease accounting requirements will need to be considered if the Company acquires a new land easement or modifies an existing land easement on January 1, 2019 or later. In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance regarding the reclassification of certain income tax effects reported in accumulated comprehensive\nincome (loss) in response to U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017 known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the TCJA). For corporations, one of the main provisions of the TCJA was the reduction in the corporate\nincome tax rate to 21% from 35%. Under current income tax accounting requirements, an entity was required to remeasure applicable \nU.S. deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at the 21% tax rate effective on the TCJA enactment date. This remeasurement was required to be recognized in an entitys income tax\nprovision in its income statement. However, certain of these deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income tax effects initially recognized at the 35% tax rate through other comprehensive income (loss) on items reported within\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on an entitys balance sheet. Consequently, an entitys financial statements will reflect an inconsistency between the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities measured at 21% and the\nrelated income tax effects in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) recorded at 35%. Accordingly, this guidance provides a one-time option to remeasure the income tax effects within accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) at the 21% income tax rate. The impact from this remeasurement is to be recorded directly in retained earnings on an entitys balance sheet. This guidance becomes effective for Alcoa Corporation on January 1,\n2019, with early adoption permitted. Management is currently evaluating whether to elect this option, as well as whether to early adopt the guidance. If management elects to apply this guidance, the impact on the Companys Consolidated Balance\nSheet is estimated to be an increase of approximately $350 to both Retained earnings and Accumulated other comprehensive loss. In June\n2018, the FASB issued guidance regarding the accounting for nonemployee share-based payment transactions. This guidance effectively changes the accounting for such transactions to be consistent with the accounting for employee share-based payment\ntransactions. The nonemployee share-based payment transactions subject to this guidance are those in which a grantor acquires goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantors own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. This\nguidance is not to be applied to other nonemployee share-based payment transactions, such as those used to effectively provide (1) financing to the issuer or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as\npart of a contract accounted for under revenue recognition principles. This guidance becomes effective for Alcoa Corporation on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The only nonemployees to receive share-based payments from Alcoa\nCorporation are the members of the Companys Board of Directors. Accordingly, management does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. C. Revenue  The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation(s) in accordance with the provisions of a customer order or\ncontract. This is achieved when control of the product has been transferred to the customer, which is generally determined when title, ownership, and risk of loss pass to the customer, all of which occurs upon shipment or delivery of the product.\nThe shipping terms vary across all businesses and depend on the product, the country of origin, and the type of transportation (commercial delivery truck, train, or vessel). Accordingly, except for the sale of electricity, the sale of Alcoa\nCorporations products to its customers represent single performance obligations for which revenue is recognized at a point in time. Based on the foregoing, no significant judgment is required to determine when control of a product has been\ntransferred to a customer. The Company measures revenue based on the consideration it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for\nits products. The standard terms and conditions of customer orders and contracts include general rights of return and product warranty provisions related to nonconforming or\nout-of-spec product. Depending on the circumstances, the product is either replaced or a quality adjustment is issued. Historically, such returns and\nadjustments have not been material to Alcoa Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company considers shipping and\nhandling activities as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the related products. As a result, customer payments of shipping and handling costs are recorded as a component of revenue. Also, Alcoa Corporation may collect various taxes (e.g.,\nsales, use, value-added, excise) from its customers related to the sale of its products and remit such amounts to governmental authorities. As such, amounts paid to the Company for these types of taxes are excluded from the transaction price used to\ndetermine the proper measurement of revenue. Alcoa Corporation has five product divisions as follows: BauxiteBauxite is a reddish clay rock that is mined from the surface of the earths terrain. This ore is the basic raw\nmaterial used to produce alumina and is the primary source of aluminum. AluminaAlumina is an oxide that is extracted from\nbauxite and is the basic raw material used to produce primary aluminum. This product can also be consumed for non-metallurgical purposes, such as industrial chemical products. Primary aluminumPrimary aluminum is metal in the form of a common alloy ingot (e.g.,\nt-bar, sow, standard ingot) or a value-add ingot (e.g., billet, rod, and slab). These products are sold primarily to customers that produce products for the\ntransportation, building and construction, packaging, wire, and other industrial markets. Flat-rolled aluminumFlat-rolled aluminum is metal in the form of sheet, which is\nsold primarily to customers that produce beverage and food cans, including body, tab, and end stock. EnergyEnergy is the\ngeneration of electricity, which is sold in the wholesale market to traders, large industrial consumers, distribution companies, and other generation companies. The following table represents the general commercial profile of the Companys Bauxite, Alumina, Primary aluminum, and Flat-rolled\naluminum product divisions (see text below table for Energy):"
