# sec-parser-validation-data

This repository supports the [sec-parser](https://github.com/alphanome-ai/sec-parser) project by holding raw SEC EDGAR documents used for various tasks, such as end-to-end testing and assumption verification. For contribution guidelines, please refer to the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/alphanome-ai/sec-parser/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## How This Repository Helps

- **End-to-End Testing**: Provides documents and their manually reviewed output to validate parsing performance.
- **Assumption Verification**: Enables running scripts to check assumptions across a large corpus of documents.

Keeping this data separate ensures a clean and manageable main code repository, aiding in maintenance and efficiency.
